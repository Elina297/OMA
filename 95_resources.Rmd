### Other relevant containers

* [DataFrame](https://rdrr.io/bioc/S4Vectors/man/DataFrame-class.html) which behaves similarly to `data.frame`, yet efficient and fast when used with large datasets.
* [DNAString](https://rdrr.io/bioc/Biostrings/man/DNAString-class.html) along with `DNAStringSet`,`RNAString` and `RNAStringSet`  efficient storage and handling of long biological sequences are offered within the [Biostrings](https://rdrr.io/bioc/Biostrings/) package.
* [GenomicRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html) offers an efficient representation and manipulation of genomic annotations and alignments, see e.g. `GRanges` and `GRangesList` at [An Introduction to the GenomicRangesPackage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GenomicRanges/inst/doc/GenomicRangesIntroduction.html).

[NGS Analysis Basics](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/rsequences/rsequences/) provides a walk-through of the above-mentioned features with detailed examples.


### Alternative containers for microbiome data

The `phyloseq` package and class became the first widely used data
container for microbiome data science in R. Many methods for taxonomic
profiling data are readily available for this class. We provide here a
short description how `phyloseq` and `*Experiment` classes relate to
each other.

`assays` : This slot is similar to `otu_table` in `phyloseq`. In a
               `SummarizedExperiment` object multiple assays, raw
               counts, transformed counts can be stored. See also
               [`MultiAssayExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html)
               for storing data from multiple `experiments` such as
               RNASeq, Proteomics, etc.  `rowData` : This slot is
               similar to `tax_table` in `phyloseq` to store taxonomic
               information.  `colData` : This slot is similar to
               `sample_data` in `phyloseq` to store information
               related to samples.  `rowTree` : This slot is similar
               to `phy_tree` in `phyloseq` to store phylogenetic tree.

In this book, you will come across terms like `FeatureIDs` and
`SampleIDs`.  `FeatureIDs` : These are basically OTU/ASV ids which are
row names in `assays` and `rowData`.  `SampleIDs` : As the name
suggests, these are sample ids which are column names in `assays` and
row names in `colData`.

`FeatureIDs` and `SampleIDs` are used but the technical terms
`rownames` and `colnames` are encouraged to be used, since they relate
to actual objects we work with.

### Bioconductor Classes {#bioc_intro}

**S4 system**

S4 class system has brought several useful features to the
object-oriented programming paradigm within R, and it is constantly
deployed in [R/Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) packages.
